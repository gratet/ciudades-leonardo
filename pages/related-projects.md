The main project previously funded by the Spanish Research Plan developed by several current research team members is POLITUR CSO2017-82156-R). It enabled identification, understanding and evaluation of the role of mobility in the configuration of tourism destinations (Gutiérrez et al 2019, 2020), the need to incorporate a renewed spatial vision in the management of the multiple mobilities acting within them (López Gay et al 2020, Rovira & Anton Clavé, 2018) and the effects of policy design (Santos and Velasco, 2018; Santos et al, 2019), institutional dynamics (Restrepo et al, 2021) and human agency (Sanz Ibáñez et al 2019) within their evolutionary dynamics. It also analysed how, with the support of the digital fingerprint associated with the current culture of tourism consumption (Brandajs & Russo, 2019) (public and private) stakeholder decision-making mechanisms are guided and how effective regulatory mechanisms can be implemented in relation to tourists’ use of space (Domènech et al, 2020). This project made also progress towards the analysis of the social impact of the research itself (Viana & Nel·lo, 2020).

Along the same lines, other recent contributions from research team members refer to analysing co-created destination images based on online travel reviews (Mariné-Roig & Huertas, 2020) and the impact of platforms in the reconfiguration of tourism destinations (Wilson, Garay & Morales, 2021). This latest contribution is part of the recently completed project and also funded by the Spanish Research Plan (ECCOLTUR G60667813) on collaborative economy and tourism spaces developed by members from the NOUTUR Group, UOC. Complementary to this is the contribution of Gonzàlez Reverté (2019)
on the relationship between smart destination projects in Spain and sustainability policies. In addition, the present ADAPTOUR proposal is coherent with the research objectives of the following competitive funded projects currently underway by members of the research team:
