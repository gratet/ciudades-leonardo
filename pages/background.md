As the world enters the second decade of the twenty-first century, tourism destinations are, perhaps more than ever before, in flux. Global dynamics of economic, social and environmental transformation caused
by climate change and the de-carbonization of economic activity in response to the environmental emergency have opened up new challenges for tourism destinations, while also intensifying other that
were already latent. If left unresolved, these trends generate intense impacts, in terms of increasing the vulnerability of destinations and decreasing their resilience capacity to face potential new future crisis situations (Cheer & Lew, 2017). This proposal is important insofar as, observing the role of tourism in the shaping of the current response capacity and dynamics of cities and regions, it aims to make a solid contribution from the social sciences and, explicitly via geographical analysis, to a number of priorities of the Spanish and European research programs (Spanish Research Plan, Green Deal and Horizon
Europe). There are those related to adaptation to climate change, energy and mobility, smart cities, digitalization and social inclusion.

The main achievement of our previous research project funded by the Spanish Research Plan (POLITUR CSO2017-82156-R – [politurproject.org](https://www.politurproject.org)) was to understand the role of mobilities as a generative cause for societal, urban and environmental change in tourism destinations. This proposal amplifies the focus of previous work as it contextualizes the evolution of tourism destinations within broader vectors of interpretation, including vulnerability, adaptability and resilience and more intense change dynamics such as the effects on the destinations of the current global economic transition and the intensified awareness of the climate emergency and its consequences (Gössling & Higham, 2020). The proposal also encompasses analysis of the processes derived from the growing decarbonisation of economic activity, widespread digitalization and the deepening of socio-spatial disparities and imbalances at different scales. Such dynamics, to which we can add the emergency situation and global health crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, unveil new additional vulnerabilities in destinations, necessitating new governance mechanisms to increase their resilience (Brouder, 2020; Gossling et al, 2020). This situates the research within the core of debates on globalization effects and their limitations at different scales and the vulnerability of complex destinations facing global changes and new economic transition strategies. It also connects the project to current challenges identified by the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.

The starting hypothesis is that global change, in particular climate emergency challenges and the decarbonising of productive systems, generate new vulnerabilities in tourist destinations. As complex
places, destinations are enhancing their resilience via co-evolutionary local human agency processes related to the adaptability to (1) the current global urban transition, (2) the transformation of mobility
systems, (3) the effects of climate change and (4) emerging new social exclusion dynamics. This is situated within the context of the digitalisation of spatial destination management and intelligence tools,
the renewal of strategic destination positioning and the design of new models of governance with enhanced social responsibility awareness.
